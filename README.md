# Data Portfolio
Repository that contains personal or academic projects about Data Analysis, Science and engineering. Everything is presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools used (at the moment):

* Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Scikitlearn.

## Contents

* ## Data Analysis

  * [StackOverflow developers survey](https://github.com/pablo4lvarez/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/StackOverflow_survey_analysis.ipynb):
  Analysis of the 2022 developers survey, that incluedes factors like finance, remote work, education, coding experience and how people learned to code. Has a few graphics using Matplotlib, and a lot of pandas and python skills.
  
  * [Suicide Rates EDA from 1985 to 2021](https://github.com/pablo4lvarez/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/suicide_rates_EDA.ipynb):
  Analyisis of the suicide rates around the world and in Chile, separating males and females using variables like GDP per capita, HDI and comparing the results between the differente countries. Has some good graphics using Matplotlib and a lot of pandas and python skills.

* ## Machine Learning
  
  * [Avengers Face-recognition](https://github.com/pablo4lvarez/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Tarea_3_IA.ipynb):
    Howework for IA course (IIC2613) in my university. I did different old-style models of face-recognition using some scikit-learn classification       algorithms, and i did a deep analysis of the results and the proccedures. Has a lot of python and pandas data manipulation skills and analysis.
    PD: The file is too big to display it on github, but you can download it!
   
  
* ## Others
  * [Fifa21 videogame data cleaning](https://github.com/pablo4lvarez/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Fifa_21_Cleaning_and_Transformation.ipynb):
    I completely focused on data manipulation and transformation. Is done on a really messy and disordered dataset of the popular videogame FIFA21.
    I show python and pandas skills to correctly manage the issues of the data, and a bit of analysis in some aspects of the dataset.
